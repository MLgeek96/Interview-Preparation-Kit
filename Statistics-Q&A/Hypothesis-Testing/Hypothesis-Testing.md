## How do you assess the statistical significance of an insight?

You would perform hypothesis testing to determine statistical significance. 

First, you would state the null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis. 

Second, you would calculate the p-value, the probability of obtaining the observed results of a test assuming that the null hypothesis is true. 

Last, you would set the level of the significance (alpha) and if the p-value is less than the alpha, you would reject the null â€” in other words, the result is statistically significant.
