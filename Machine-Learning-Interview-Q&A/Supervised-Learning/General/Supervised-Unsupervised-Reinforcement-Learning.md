## What is the difference between supervised learning and unsupervised learning? Give concrete examples

Supervised learning involves learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs

Unsupervised learning is used to draw inferences and find patterns from input data without references to labeled outcomes. A common use of unsupervised learning is grouping customers by purchasing behavior to find target markets.
