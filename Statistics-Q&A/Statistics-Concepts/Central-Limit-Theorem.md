## What is the Central Limit Theorem? Explain it. Why is it important?

Statistics How To provides the best definition of CLT, which is:

"The central limit theorem states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size gets larger no matter what the shape of the population distribution." [1]

The central limit theorem is important because it is used in hypothesis testing and also to calculate confidence intervals.
